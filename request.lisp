external format to be used to decode the content will be determined
from the `charset' parameter sent by the client \(or otherwise

You can also provide an external format explicitly \(through
EXTERNAL-FORMAT) in which case the result will unconditionally be a
string.  Likewise, you can provide a true value for FORCE-TEXT which
will force Hunchentoot to act as if the type of the media type had
been \"text\".  Or you can provide a true value for FORCE-BINARY which
means that you want a vector of octets at any rate.

If, however, you provide a true value for WANT-STREAM, the other
parameters are ignored and you'll get the content \(flexi) stream to
read from it yourself.  It is then your responsibility to read the
correct amount of data, because otherwise you won't be able to return
a response to the client.  If the content type of the request was
`multipart/form-data' or `application/x-www-form-urlencoded', the
content has been read by Hunchentoot already and you can't read from
the stream anymore.

You can call RAW-POST-DATA more than once per request, but you can't
mix calls which have different values for WANT-STREAM.

content even if the request method is not POST."
