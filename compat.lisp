Executes a series of forms with each VAR bound to a fresh,

to GENSYM with the string denoted by X - or, if X is not supplied, the
string denoted by VAR - as argument.

The variable bindings created are lexical unless special declarations
are specified. The scopes of the name bindings and declarations do not
include the Xs.

The forms are evaluated in order, and the values of all but the last
are discarded \(that is, the body is an implicit PROGN)."
