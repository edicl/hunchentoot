(defmacro with-log-stream ((stream-var destination lock) &body body)
  "Helper macro to write log entries.  STREAM-VAR is a symbol that
will be bound to the logging stream during the execution of BODY.
DESTINATION is the logging destination, which can be either a pathname
designator of the log file, a symbol designating an open stream or NIL
if no logging should be done.  LOCK refers to the lock that should be
held during the logging operation.  If DESTINATION is a pathname, a
flexi stream with UTF-8 encoding will be created and bound to
STREAM-VAR.  If an error occurs while writing to the log file, that
error will be logged to *ERROR-OUTPUT*.

Note that logging to a file involves opening and closing the log file
for every logging operation, which is overall costly.  Web servers
with high throughput demands should make use of a specialized logging
function rather than relying on Hunchentoot's default logging
facility."
